## 🧠 Profile

I am a biomedical engineer and interdisciplinary researcher with a focus on neurotechnology, functional brain imaging, and embedded systems. My work bridges hardware design and AI-driven signal processing for fNIRS, EEG, and BCI applications. With hands-on expertise in circuit and system design, signal acquisition, and deep learning models for biomedical signals, I develop integrated solutions for real-time brain monitoring and medical diagnostics. I am currently contributing to research and teaching at HTW Berlin, while actively collaborating on international projects in neuroscience and biomedical engineering.
